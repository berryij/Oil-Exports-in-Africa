# Oil-Exports-in-Africa

This map is meant to show the Export of Oil in Africa in 2018. This can be used to compare the exports of oil over time if other data is found, as well as to see which countries in Africa produce more oil than others. The data comes from Our World in Data and was edited to only show values from 2018. The Circles are scaled to show the smallest values have no exports, and the other circles scale based on thier export values. When hovered, the circles display thier exports as well as thier country name. A legend is provided to compare the circles to their exports, as well as to show what units the oil is being measured. There is a breif title to explain the map, as the circles are orange to contrast with the basemap. The over is also blue to highlight which circle you are looking at.
